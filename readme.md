Watson is a question answering computer system capable of answering questions posed in natural language, developed in IBM's DeepQA project by a research team led by principal investigator David Ferrucci. Watson was named after IBM's first CEO and industrialist Thomas J. Watson.

Totally Watson includes 12 services in it.

Mainly we focussed on Natural Language Understanding and Tone Analyser

Concepts

Recognize high-level concepts that are related to your text. For example, analysis of a research paper about deep learning would likely return the concept "Artificial Intelligence", even if that term is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

Sentiment

Analyze the general sentiment of your content or analyze the sentiment toward specific target phrases found in the text.



TONE ANALYZER
